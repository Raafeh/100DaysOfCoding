# Pascal's Triangle

## Problem Description

Given an integer `numRows`, you need to generate the first `numRows` rows of Pascal's triangle.

### Example

#### Input:

```
numRows = 5
```

#### Output:

```
[
     [1],
    [1,1],
   [1,2,1],
  [1,3,3,1],
 [1,4,6,4,1]
]
```

## Approach and Solution

We can solve this problem using a simple algorithm in Python. Here's how the solution works:

1. We initialize the result list with the first row, which contains a single element: `[1]`.
2. We then iterate from `1` to `numRows - 1`, generating each subsequent row.
3. To generate a new row, we start with `[1]` as the first element.
4. For each row element from the second element to the second-to-last element, we calculate its value by summing the corresponding elements from the previous row and add it to the new row.
5. Finally, we add `[1]` as the last element of the new row.
6. We repeat this process for each row until we have generated `numRows` rows.
7. The result is a list of lists representing Pascal's triangle up to the specified number of rows.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(numRows^2), where `numRows` is the number of rows in Pascal's triangle. This is because, for each row, we generate all its elements by summing the elements from the previous row.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is O(numRows^2) as well, as we store the entire Pascal's triangle in memory as a list of lists. The space required is directly proportional to the number of rows generated.
