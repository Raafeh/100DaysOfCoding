# Find the Difference

## Problem Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, where string `t` is generated by randomly shuffling string `s` and then adding one more letter at a random position. The task is to find and return the letter that was added to string `t`.

### Example

**Input:**

```
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"
```

**Output:**

```
"e"
```

Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added to string `t`.

## Approach and Solution

To solve this problem efficiently in O(n) time complexity, we can utilize the XOR bitwise operation. The key idea is to XOR all the characters in both strings `s` and `t`. The result of this XOR operation will be the character that was added to string `t`.

Here's a high-level overview of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `result` to 0.
2. Iterate through all characters in string `s` and XOR their ASCII values with `result`.
3. Iterate through all characters in string `t` and XOR their ASCII values with `result`.
4. The final value of `result` will be the ASCII value of the added character.
5. Convert this ASCII value back to a character to obtain the added character.


### Time and Space Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the longer of the two input strings `s` and `t`. This is because we iterate through both strings once.

- Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space for the `result` variable.
