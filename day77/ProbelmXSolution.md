# Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero

## Problem Description

Given an array `nums` and an integer `x`, you need to find the minimum number of operations to reduce `x` to exactly 0. You can perform the following operations:

1. Remove the leftmost or rightmost element from the array `nums`.
2. Subtract the value of the removed element from `x`.

## Examples

- Example 1:

  Input: `nums = [1,1,4,2,3]`, `x = 5`
  
  Output: `2`
  
  Explanation: The optimal solution is to remove the last two elements to reduce `x` to zero.

- Example 2:

  Input: `nums = [5,6,7,8,9]`, `x = 4`
  
  Output: `-1`
  
- Example 3:

  Input: `nums = [3,2,20,1,1,3]`, `x = 10`
  
  Output: `5`
  
  Explanation: The optimal solution is to remove the last three elements and the first two elements (5 operations in total) to reduce `x` to zero.

## Approach and Solution 

The solution to this problem involves a sliding window approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Calculate the total sum of all elements in the array `nums`.
2. Calculate the target value as `total_sum - x`. We want to find a subarray with a sum equal to this target.
3. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to keep track of the current subarray.
4. Use a while loop to expand the subarray from the right side while the current sum is greater than the target.
5. Check if the current sum is equal to the target. If it is, calculate the number of operations required to remove the remaining elements outside the subarray to make the sum equal to `x`.
6. Update the minimum number of operations as needed.
7. Continue the process until the `right` pointer reaches the end of the array.
8. If a valid subarray with a sum equal to the target is found, return the minimum number of operations. Otherwise, return -1.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` array. This is because we iterate through the array once using the sliding window approach.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of the code is O(1) as we use a constant amount of extra space to store variables regardless of the input size.
