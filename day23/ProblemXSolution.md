# Predict the Winner

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `nums`. Two players are playing a game with this array: Player 1 and Player 2.

Player 1 and Player 2 take turns, with Player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of 0. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., `nums[0]` or `nums[nums.length - 1]`), which reduces the size of the array by 1. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.

The task is to determine if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then Player 1 is still considered the winner, and you should return true. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.

## Example

**Input:**

`nums = [1, 5, 2]`

**Output:**

`False`

**Explanation:**

Initially, Player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. If he chooses 2 (or 1), then Player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If Player 2 chooses 5, then Player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). So, the final score of Player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and Player 2 is 5. Hence, Player 1 will never be the winner, and the function should return `False`.

**Input:**

`nums = [1, 5, 233, 7]`

**Output:**

`True`

**Explanation:**

Player 1 first chooses 1. Then Player 2 has to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number Player 2 chooses, Player 1 can choose 233. Finally, Player 1 has a higher score (234) than Player 2 (12), so the function should return `True`, representing that Player 1 can win.

## Approach and Solution

To solve this problem, we use dynamic programming to find the optimal strategy for both players and determine if Player 1 can win the game.

We create a 2D dynamic programming table `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum score difference between Player 1 and Player 2 when they are playing with the subarray `nums[i:j+1]`.

The recurrence relation for `dp[i][j]` can be defined as follows:
- If `i == j`, then `dp[i][j] = nums[i]` (only one number to choose from).
- Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = max(nums[i] - dp[i+1][j], nums[j] - dp[i][j-1])`.

The logic behind the recurrence relation is that at each turn, the current player can choose either the leftmost or rightmost number in the subarray. The current player will choose the number that gives them the maximum score difference compared to the score of the opponent in the next state.

Finally, we check if `dp[0][n-1]` (where `n` is the length of the `nums` array) is greater than or equal to zero. If it is, it means Player 1 can win or achieve a tie, and we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.

The time complexity of the solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we fill in the 2D dynamic programming table `dp` of size n x n.

The space complexity of the solution is O(n^2) as well since we use a 2D array `dp` of size n x n to store intermediate results.
