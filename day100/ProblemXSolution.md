# Ransom Note 

## Problem Description

Given two strings `ransomNote` and `magazine`, you are asked to determine if you can construct the `ransomNote` using characters from the `magazine`. Each character in the `magazine` can only be used once in the `ransomNote`. You need to return `true` if it's possible to construct the `ransomNote`, and `false` otherwise.

### Example

- Input: `ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"`
- Output: `true`
- Explanation: You can construct the `ransomNote` "aa" from the characters in the `magazine`, as it contains two 'a's and one 'b'.

## Approach and Solution

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Create two dictionaries, `ransomNote_freq` and `magazine_freq`, to count the frequency of characters in the `ransomNote` and the `magazine`, respectively.
2. Loop through the `ransomNote` and the `magazine` strings, counting the frequencies of each character in the corresponding dictionaries.
3. Next, we iterate through the characters in the `ransomNote`. For each character, we check if it exists in the `magazine` and whether its frequency in the `ransomNote` is less than or equal to its frequency in the `magazine`. If these conditions hold true for all characters in the `ransomNote`, we return `true`, indicating that the `ransomNote` can be constructed from the `magazine`. Otherwise, we return `false`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the `ransomNote` string, as we iterate through it once to count the frequencies. 

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is also O(n) because we use two dictionaries to store character frequencies.
