# Minimal Length of Subarray Sum

## Problem Description
Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, the task is to find the minimal length of a subarray in `nums` whose sum is greater than or equal to `target`. If there is no such subarray, the function should return 0.

## Example
```
Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
```
Explanation: The subarray with the minimal length whose sum is greater than or equal to 7 is [4, 3], which has a length of 2.

## Approach and Solution
To solve this problem, we can use the sliding window technique. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, both pointing to the start of the array `nums`.
2. Initialize two variables, `minLength` and `currentSum`, to track the minimal length of the subarray and the current sum of the subarray, respectively. Set `minLength` to a large value initially.
3. Iterate the `right` pointer from left to right over the array `nums`:
   - Add `nums[right]` to the `currentSum`.
   - While `currentSum` is greater than or equal to the `target`, update the `minLength` if the length of the current subarray (`right - left + 1`) is smaller than the current `minLength`. Then, subtract `nums[left]` from the `currentSum` and move the `left` pointer to the right by one position.
4. After the loop ends, check if `minLength` is still a large value. If so, return 0 since there is no subarray with a sum greater than or equal to the `target`.
5. Otherwise, return the `minLength` as the answer.

The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. The space complexity is O(1), as the algorithm only uses a fixed number of variables to keep track of the indices and values during the computation.
