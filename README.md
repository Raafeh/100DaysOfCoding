# 100 Days of Coding Challenge Repository

Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding Challenge repository! ðŸš€

## Introduction

In this repository, I will be documenting my journey as I take on the #100daysofcoding challenge. Over the course of the next 100 days, I will be solving a coding problem each day from LeetCode. The problems will primarily be of Easy to Medium difficulty, with occasional excursions into more challenging Hard level problems.

## Motivation

The main objective of this challenge is to enhance my problem-solving skills, deepen my understanding of coding concepts, and ultimately become a better programmer. By dedicating time each day to tackle coding problems, I aim to refine my ability to analyze and break down problems, while also exploring different algorithms and data structures to improve my coding efficiency.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- **/dayX**: Each day's code solution will be placed in a separate folder, labeled as "day-X" where "X" represents the day number of the challenge.
- **/dayX/problem.md**: This file contains the problem statement for the respective day's coding challenge.
- **/dayX/solution.py**: Here, you will find my solution to the coding problem in the form of a Python script.


## Join Me on this Journey

I invite all fellow coding enthusiasts, developers, and learners to join me on this coding journey. Whether you're a seasoned programmer or just starting out, your participation and support are highly appreciated. Let's learn from each other, inspire one another, and grow together as a community of passionate programmers.

If you're interested in contributing to this repository, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. Contributions, improvements, and alternative solutions are always welcome!

## Let's Connect

I'm excited to share my progress with you throughout this challenge. Connect with me on LinkedIn ([Raafeh Sajjad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raafeh-sajjad-3a35b71b6/)) to stay updated on my daily coding solutions and engage in insightful discussions.

Let's make the next 100 days count and embark on an incredible coding adventure together! ðŸš€
