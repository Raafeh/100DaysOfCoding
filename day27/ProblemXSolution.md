# Combinations 

## Problem Description

Given two integers `n` and `k`, we need to find all possible combinations of `k` numbers chosen from the range `[1, n]`. The order of the elements in each combination does not matter, and we should return the combinations in any order.

**Example 1:**
Input: `n = 4`, `k = 2`
Output: `[[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]`
Explanation: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 total combinations.

**Example 2:**
Input: `n = 1`, `k = 1`
Output: `[[1]]`
Explanation: There is 1 choose 1 = 1 total combination.

## Approach and Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking algorithm. The idea is to explore all possible combinations by choosing each number from 1 to `n` as the first element of the combination. Then, we recursively select the remaining `k-1` elements from the remaining numbers.

The backtracking algorithm proceeds as follows:
1. Define a recursive function `backtrack(start, path)` to generate combinations.
2. If the length of `path` becomes equal to `k`, we have a valid combination, so we add a copy of the current combination to the result.
3. For each number `num` from `start` to `n`, we add `num` to the current combination and call `backtrack(num + 1, path)` recursively with the updated start value.
4. After exploring all combinations with `num`, we backtrack by removing the last element from the `path` to explore other combinations.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is not straightforward. However, in the worst case, we can estimate it to be approximately O(C(n, k) * k), where C(n, k) denotes the number of combinations. For each combination, we need to make a copy of the current combination and add it to the result, which takes O(k) time.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(k), which is the maximum depth of the recursive call stack. Additionally, the space to store the combinations in the result list is also considered, but it does not contribute significantly to the overall space complexity.
