# Minimize the Maximum Difference of Pairs

This repository contains a solution to the "Minimum Maximum Difference of Pairs" problem, along with an explanation of the problem statement and the correct implementation in Python.

## Problem Statement

Given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` and an integer `p`, the task is to find `p` pairs of indices in `nums` such that the maximum difference amongst all the pairs is minimized. The goal is to return the minimum maximum difference among all `p` pairs.

## Example

**Input:**
```python
nums = [10, 1, 2, 7, 1, 3]
p = 2
```

**Output:**
```
1
```

In this example, the first pair is formed from the indices 1 and 4 (|1 - 1| = 0), and the second pair is formed from the indices 2 and 5 (|2 - 3| = 1). The maximum difference is 1, which is the minimum we can attain for the given `p`.

## Approach and Solution

The provided solution addresses the problem using a binary search-based approach combined with a greedy strategy. The steps of the solution are as follows:

1. Sort the `nums` array in ascending order.
2. Define a function `can_form_pairs` that checks whether it's possible to form `p` pairs with a maximum difference of `mid`.
3. Initialize the binary search range `left` and `right` as 0 and the difference between the largest and smallest elements of `nums`, respectively.
4. While `left` is less than `right`, calculate the middle value `mid` and call the `can_form_pairs` function to determine whether it's possible to form `p` pairs with a maximum difference of `mid`.
5. If it's possible to form the required number of pairs, narrow down the search range by setting `right = mid`. Otherwise, set `left = mid + 1`.
6. Once the binary search is completed, return the value of `left`, which represents the minimum maximum difference among all `p` pairs.

## Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is dominated by the binary search, which performs O(log(max_diff)) iterations, where max_diff is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the `nums` array. Inside the binary search, the `can_form_pairs` function checks pairs in linear time, making its time complexity O(n).

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the solution is O(n * log(max_diff)).

The space complexity is relatively low, as the solution primarily uses a few variables for iteration and comparison. Hence, the space complexity is O(1).
